                    My favorite jazz album is <em>Kind of Blue</em> (1959) by trumpet legend

                    One of the most famous jazz albums in history, with a number of
                    tunes having since become "standards" (tunes frequently covered 
                    by other jazz artists). On the recording are jazz virtuosos

                    <p>
                    Another great album is <em>Moanin'</em> (1958) by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers.

                    <p>
                    The Jazz Messengers started out as a collective in the early 50s and ended when their
                    founder (Art Blakey) died in 1990. Art was a phenomenal drummer that played with the likes
                    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelonious_Monk">Thelonious Monk</a> and 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker">Charlie Parker</a>. The Messengers
                    transformed into somewhat of a school for up and coming jazz artists to hone their craft
                    and prove their worth. 

                    <p>Many Messenger alumni went on to become jazz stars in their own right, such as:

                    <h4 class="media-heading">Solo Monk</h4>
                    <p>One of my favorite jazz pianists is Thelonious Monk. You have probably heard me play some of his tunes. 
                    Most newcomers to jazz have a hard time enjoying Monk, because of his signature usage of the
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYfAORcSBUc">whole tone scale</a> and how he often played "out"
                    of the scale the song was "in".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    That being said, he has some beautiful works that even new jazz listeners will love. One I recommend is
                    "Ruby, My Dear" from his album <em>Solo Monk</em>.

                    is considered one of the most skilled piano players to have ever lived. He was pure chops,
                    and no track demonstrates his command of the instrument better than his performance of the standard
                    "Blue Skies". It's hard to convince yourself that only one person is playing the piano.

                    From the personnel of <em>Kind of Blue</em>, we have another one of my favorite pianists: Bill Evans.

                    Here is his title track composition from the album <em>Waltz for Debby</em> with bassist
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_LaFaro">Scott LaFaro</a> and drummer

                    <p>
                    Here is some Latin Jazz you ought to recognize. This album was a collaboration between 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joao_Gilberto">Jo&atilde;o Gilberto</a> (singer and guitarist) and 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Getz">Stan Getz</a> (saxophinist). Gilberto's then wife 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrud_Gilberto">Astrud Gilberto</a> had never sung professionally before this album,
                    and the first track ("The Girl from Ipanema") became a worldwide success, launching her to superstar status. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Notice I said "then wife"... Shortly after the album, Stan and Astrud had an affair, which brought an end to the
                    both the musical partnership of Getz/Gilberto and to the partnership between Jo&atilde;o and Astrud (can't seem to 
                    find all the details of the story, but I'm pretty sure thats how it went down).

        </ul>

        <p>
        From here, I recommend going on Spotify and starting a jazz radio (you can start radios based off a song, so pick 
        your favorite from above). If the radio playlist brings up a song you like, go to the album and listen to the whole thing.
        If you like that, check out their other work and "Related Artists". Also, get Dad's take! He has a much larger mental
        library of jazz than I do.
